tutorial_question    "Would you like to view the tutorial?  Click the green Continue button to start the tutorial, or click the red Stop button to skip the tutorial."


tutorial_welcome1     "The tutorial window freezes the game in the background.  When you're done reading a given tutorial message, click the green Continue button."


tutorial_welcome2     "This tutorial will walk you through a full game of Cultivation.  Fair warning:  it may reveal details and strategies that would be more fun to discover on your own."


tutorial_moving   "First things first:  moving around.  Click on the map to move your gardener.  Click the green Continue button to try it."


tutorial_survival1   "Your first goal is basic survival.  If you don't eat, your nutrients will become depleted, and you will age faster."


tutorial_survival2   "There are three nutrients:  Red, Yellow, and Purple.  The three spheres at the rear of your gardener show your nutrient levels."


tutorial_survival3   "You use nutrients faster when you are actively moving around or carrying something like water."


tutorial_survival4   "You can replenish nutrients by eating fruit, but you need to obtain some first.  One way to get fruit is to grow it yourself."


tutorial_seeds1   "You start the game with some seeds stored in your left side bar.  You can plant them to grow fruit."


tutorial_plot   "But before you can do that, you need to pick a plot of land for yourself.  Click the Plot button and then click-and-drag a rectangle on the map."


tutorial_plant   "Now move into your plot, click a stored seed to select it, and then click the Plant button."


tutorial_water1   "Your seedling needs water to grow.  Move into the water and press the Water button to pick up water."


tutorial_water2   "Move back to your seedling and press the Water button again to dump the water."


tutorial_water3   "A tan circle over a plant means it has stopped growing and needs more water.  Once a plant is full-grown, you can stop watering it."

tutorial_plot2   "You can only tend plants that are in your plot, but you can change your plot at any time."

tutorial_plot3   "Your plot can overlap with the plots of other gardeners.  In that case, you and the others would be in conflict over the plants in the overlap."



tutorial_harvest1   "You have some ripe fruit in your plot.  Move near the plant and press the Harvest button."


tutorial_eat1   "A fruit is now stored in your left side bar.  Click the fruit to select it, and then click the Eat button to eat it."

tutorial_eat2   "A fruit of a given color is high in that color nutrient, but it contains only trace amounts of the other color nutrients."

tutorial_seeds2   "Notice that eating a fruit gave you another stored seed.  Each fruit contains one seed."

tutorial_seeds3   "The color of a seed shows what kind of soil it prefers.  Light seeds like light soil, and dark seeds like dark soil.  An ideal soil type makes a plant grow faster."

tutorial_seeds4   "The colored circle next to each seed shows what color fruit will be produced by the resulting plant."

tutorial_seeds5   "To produce fruit, plants crossbreed with whatever plant is closest to them.  Seeds from the resulting fruit will grow genetic hybrid plants."

tutorial_seeds6   "By placing certain plants close together, you can selectively breed desirable traits.  For example, you might try to breed plants with heavy fruit loads."





tutorial_gift1   "You can also give fruit to another gardener.  First, move near the other gardener.  Click the fruit to select it, and then click the Give button."


tutorial_emotion1   "Your gift made that gardener like you a bit more.  The green + that flew back to you indicated the other gardener's pleasure."


tutorial_emotion2   "If you see a red x flying toward your gardener, that means you are making another gardener angry."

tutorial_emotion3   "You can make other gardeners angry by planting in their plots or harvesting from their plants.  This can only happen if your plots overlap."



tutorial_lifespan1   "Your lifespan is represented by the plasma ball at the center of your gardener.  It just shrunk to half its size, so that means your life is half over."

tutorial_lifespan2a   "You already have produced an offspring, so you will take control of that offspring when you die."

tutorial_lifespan2b   "You're already pregnant.  If you can successfully give birth before you die, you will take control of that offspring when your current life ends."

tutorial_lifespan2c   "Your biological clock is ticking.  It's time to think about mating.  If you have no offspring when you die, your game will end."


tutorial_mating1   "To mate, move near another gardener.  If they like you enough, and if they are not already pregnant, the Mate button will be enabled."


tutorial_mating2   "If they don't like you enough to mate, give them a gift or two.  What's that old saying... Candy is dandy?  Well, fruit will have to suffice."

tutorial_mating3   "You can make another gardener angry by mating with a gardener that it likes a lot.  Be careful when you pick a mate."


tutorial_pregnant1   "You're pregnant.  Keep all three nutrient levels up so that the pregnancy can progress."



tutorial_birth1   "Congratulations, you just gave birth to a bouncing baby... gardener!  Your baby will follow you and share all the food you eat for a while."

tutorial_birth2   "Eat a balanced diet to keep your baby growing.  Once full grown, it will head out on its own."


tutorial_poisoned1  "You just moved across poisoned ground, and some of your stored fruit became poisoned."

tutorial_poisoned2  "Eating poisoned fruit will bring on a quick death."



tutorial_death1   "You just died.  Notice the ring that will form at the location of your death.  That is the first ring in the gate to immortality."

tutorial_death2   "Four more rings must be opened before the gate itself opens.  The gardeners you control are special:  they have the power to open these rings by dying."

tutorial_death3   "To open more rings, you need to bring your future gardeners back to the center of the gate right before they die."

tutorial_death4  "If your gardener dies away from the site of an existing gate, no new ring will be opened."

tutorial_death5  "A gate is destroyed by poisoned ground.  If this happens, you will need to start a new gate elsewhere."



tutorial_death1a   "You just died again.  This time, you have no offspring to take control of, so your game is over.  Hit the Restart button to start a new game."

tutorial_death6a   "Unfortunately, you have no offspring to take control of, so your game is over.  Hit the Restart button to start a new game."

tutorial_death6b   "You just took control of your next offspring."



tutorial_gate1   "The gate to immortality is now open.  Each gardener that moves into the gate will become immortal."

tutorial_gate2   "When your gardener moves into the gate, the gate will close, and no other gardeners will be able to pass through it."

tutorial_gate3   "If you want to take some gardeners with you, you will need to lead them through the gate without stepping into the gate yourself."

tutorial_gate4   "You can use the Lead button to do this.  Gardeners will only follow you if they like you a lot, though."

tutorial_gate5   "The more gardeners you save, the larger your reward."


tutorial_immortal1  "The gate to immortality has now closed, and the gardeners you chose have been immortalized."

tutorial_immortal2  "You have received your reward, but you might not have found it yet.  The reward is something that you can take with you outside the game."

tutorial_immortal3  "Quit the game, and then take a look around for your reward.  Or, if you are a spoil-sport, click the Continue button in this tutorial for a hint."


tutorial_immortal4  "Are you sure you want a hint?"


tutorial_immortal5  "Look at the immortal PNG file in in your Cultivation folder.  You should be able to view it with a web browser."
