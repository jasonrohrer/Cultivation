<h2>Game Description</h2>

Cultivation explores the social interactions within a gardening community.  You lead one family of gardeners, starting with a single individual, and wise choices can keep your genetic line from extinction.  While breeding plants, eating, and mating, your actions impact your neighbors, and the social balance sways between conflict and compromise.<BR>
<BR>
Cultivation features dynamic graphics that are procedurally-generated using genetic representations and cross-breeding.  In other words, game objects are "grown" in real-time instead of being hand-painted or hard-coded.  Each plant and gardener in the game is unique in terms of both its appearance and behavior.

<h2>Quotes</h2>

"Unique games have a tendency to wash up on the Linux shores every so often.
